Part Two Reflection 

Our journey into modifying existing WordPress themes for the JCU website started with a comprehensive review of our objectives. We carefully evaluated the criteria for the website development process, emphasizing the need for effective communication through channels like Slack, GitHub, Discord, and personal exchanges. Recognizing the diverse talents within our group, we aimed to harness these strengths for the optimal development of the JCU website.

Deciding on our decision-making approach, we opted for a collaborative effort, valuing input from every team member. The inclusivity and transparency of our decision-making process were emphasized, with a voting system introduced for major changes. We acknowledged the challenges of handling criticism and contrasting ideas.

Time Management:
To ensure efficient time management, roles for Flask and GitHub managers were assigned, along with specific tasks. Regular assessments confirmed our adherence to project timelines, and future goals were outlined for subsequent meetings, including completing the first iteration of the localhost website.

Action Items and Follow-up:
Our progress was systematically reviewed, with a focus on setting up necessary applications and basic website hosting. Plans for further development using Figma were established, ensuring a structured approach to website modification and iteration.

Participation and Engagement:
We evaluated the level of engagement and participation among team members, aiming to enhance contributions from all stakeholders in future meetings. Each member had the opportunity to contribute, and strategies for increased participation were considered.

Meeting Environment:
Our meetings were strategically conducted at the end of practical sessions and in the library for effective communication. Operations transitioned smoothly from practical sessions to focused development work, maximizing the use of available time.

Challenges and Learning in WordPress Theme Modification:
The process of learning to modify existing WordPress themes presented its challenges. Developing the JCU website from scratch required a deep dive into technologies like CSS, HTML, and PHP code. The transition to a WordPress localhost environment and the development process in Figma were initially daunting but became essential components of our learning journey.

Presentation Creation Challenges:
Created a presentation to showcase our progress was equally challenging. Integrating the newly acquired skills and technologies into a coherent presentation demanded attention to detail and effective communication of our development journey.

Management and Roles:
Our management approach improved with well-defined roles and tasks. Leveraging the modules learned at the university, we capitalized on each team member's strengths. This collaborative effort ensured a more streamlined and efficient project development process.

Meeting Environment and Online Collaboration:
While meetings were primarily held in classrooms after school, the transition to online collaboration via Discord groups on the weekends allowed for flexibility and continued progress. This adaptability became crucial, especially when dealing with the complexities of learning new technologies.

Preparation for Final Design and Learning Tools:
As we approached the final design of the website, our preparation involved honing the tools and skills acquired. The utilization of learned tools and technologies became integral to the success of our project. The ongoing learning process contributed to our ability to adapt and innovate in the ever-evolving field of web development.

In summary, our journey in modifying WordPress themes for the JCU website was marked by challenges, collaborative learning, and strategic management. The impact of our meetings and decisions resonates in the cohesion of our team and the progress made towards our project goals.

  <h2>Local Environments</h2>

    <p>Using the Underscores template, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, XAMPP (for local server environments), multiple databases (for data management), and Slack, WhatsApp, and Discord for team management and communication, our team creates WordPress websites.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>In order to develop our product, we used the open-source server package XAMPP v3.3.0, which allowed us to simulate a live server environment on a local machine. This provided the necessary infrastructure for us to install and run the CMS we chose, WordPress 6.4.2, which was the most recent version at the time and offered us a flexible and user-friendly interface. We were tasked with creating the product using only HTML, JS, PHP, and CSS; the entire codebase was created and refined in Visual Studio Code, streamlining the development process with its code editing, debugging, and GitHub Source Control in real time so that our agile team could update our work quickly. However, we were unable to fully utilize the capabilities of WP plug-ins.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>It is important to note that the Underscores (_s) theme gave us a simple framework on which to build a distinctive and customized theme free from unnecessary design elements. We used this to build our fully functional website.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>In conclusion, the project was hosted locally using XAMPP integrating with WordPress as Local Environment, embedded in the XAMPP "htdocs" folder, for deployment and iterative development. This approach ensured extensive testing and refinement in a controlled environment, enabling testing and review of all WP components prior to live deployment. The staging URL was https://localhost/wordpress-6.4.2/wordpress/.</p>

  <h2>Hosting Providers Overview</h2>

  <p>This section compares several WordPress hosting providers, outlining the benefits and drawbacks of each. The intention is to assist in choosing a suitable hosting company for a WordPress website that has been exported from a local setting.</p>
  
  <h3>Free Hosting Providers:</h3>

  <h4>1. 000WebHost</h4>

    <ul>

        <li class="pros">Free with support for MySQL and PHP, install WordPress with just one click </li>

        <li class="cons">restricted bandwidth and disk space, forced advertisements on free tiers</li>

    </ul>

  <h4>2. AwardSpace</h4>

    <ul>

        <li class="pros">One email account is included for free with ad-free hosting. </li>

        <li class="cons">Limited storage and bandwidth; the free plan only allows one domain</li>

    </ul>
  
  <h3>Paid Hosting Providers:</h3>
  
  <h4>1. SiteGround</h4>

    <ul>

        <li class="pros">Outstanding client service, Free SSL, CDN, and automated update features for WordPress managed hosting</li>

        <li class="cons">More expensive than others, with less storage available on lesser-tier plans</li>

    </ul>

  <h4>2. Hostinger</h4>

    <ul>

        <li class="pros">Make sure that your website loads quickly and has a high uptime rate so that users can access it whenever they need to.</li>

        <li class="cons">The 100s of thousands of webpages, 100-200GB storage, and limitless bandwidth are all erroneous.</li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Selection Rationale for Hostinger</h2>
  <p>Hostinger was selected according to a number of factors relevant to the project's specifications:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Budget: Although it costs a lot, one of our members has already purchased it.</li>
      <li>Simplicity: Provides a rapid and simple setup that is perfect for pilot projects and small-scale rollouts.</li>
      <li>Flexibility: Provides adequate resources for a beginner website, with opportunities to upgrade to a paid service if necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every hosting company has a different set of features, and the ideal option will vary depending on the demands of the particular project in terms of size, performance, support, and budget. Hostinger is a great place to start because of its free service, which makes it appropriate for small WordPress projects.</p>
